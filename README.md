# Repository with various graph algorithms implemented in python

### Requirements -
  - ''' networx ''' => can be installed using '''pip install networkx''' or '''pip3 install networkx'''
  
### Usage -
  - '''python3 [script name] {number of nodes} {probabbility of edge creation}
    - example '''python3 df.py 100 0.5'''
  - It creates a random graph does Breadth First Search 
  - It displays the path from destination node to start node
    - Currently start and destination node values are supplied inside the script but can change it to take user generated input
  

### Algorithms list -

- [x] Breadth First Search



### Note -
- Sometimes this can throw error as the graphs are genrerated randomely and some nodes might be missing
